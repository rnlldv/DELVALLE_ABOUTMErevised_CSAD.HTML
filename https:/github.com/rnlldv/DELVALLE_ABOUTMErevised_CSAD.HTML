		<H2>Childhood Years</H2>
		<HR class="hr3" align="center"></HR>
			<P>
		
			&nbsp&nbsp I am <ins><i>Reinelle John</i></ins> and it was the name given to me by my parents when I was born on the year 2000, 28th day of July.<sup>(1)</sup>
			Through that, it's easy to say that I am now 20 years of age.<sup>(2)</sup>
			My family members call me by my real name but most of my friends call me by my nickname, <i><Small>RJ</small></i>. <sup>(3)</sup>
			In terms of family, I have one <i>older brother, one older sister, and a little sister</i>. <sup>(4)</sup>
			I would say I am more of a <em>Lola's boy</em> ever since my parents <em>split up</em>.<sup>(5)</sup>
			My mom went to work <i>abroad</i> while my dad works and live in pasig while i stay in <i>Rizal</i> at that time.<sup>(6)</sup>
			In result, my grandmother on my mom's side had a huge <em>impact</em> to me while I was growing up.<sup>(7)</sup>
			Currently, I am residing in <i>Mandaluyong City</i> but I originally grew up in <i>Rizal</i>.<sup>(8)</sup>
			There, I have met lots of friends where we played several games that kids used to play when there were still no <i>technology</i>.<sup>(9)</sup>
			Some of our <i>favorite games</i> that we always play were <i>hide-and-seek, patintero, luksong baka, and habul-habulan</i>.<sup>(10)</sup>
			<em>Being a kid was really fun</em>.<sup>(11)</sup>
			I didn't really care about anything back then.<sup>(12)</sup>
			No pressure with studies and real life, just pure fun while playing with my childhood friends.<sup>(13)</sup>
			I played with them during holidays, vacation, or even after going to school. <sup>(14)</sup>
			Speaking of school, I went to <i>Mater Feliz Montessori School</i> during my kindergarten years.<sup>(15)</sup>
			From Grades 1-3, I went to <i>Knights and Archers Montessori School</i>.<sup>(16)</sup>
			After that, I then went to <i>Colegio de Saint Monique</i>,I studied there for 3 years also, from Grades 4-6.<sup>(17)</sup>
			It was easy for me to go to school since <i>Colegio de Saint Monique</i> is located inside our subdivision, which is <i>Saint Monique Valais</i>. <sup>(18)</sup>
			The view in our subdivision is breathtaking, there are lots of trees and it will give you a <em>sense of peace</em>.<sup>(19)</sup>
			Unfortunately, both my parents decided that me and my siblings should take our time to live with my dad and continue studying high school in another school.<sup>(20)</sup>

		<H2>Teenage Years</H2>
		<HR class="hr3" align="center"></HR>
			<P>
		
			&nbsp&nbsp They say that <i>teenage years</i> are the <em>best years</em> of our lives, and I could agree with that statement.<sup>(1)</sup>
			When my teenage years started, I had to live with my dad and move to another school.<sup>(2)</sup>
			From Rizal, we moved to <i>Pasig City</i> at my dad's house.<sup>(3)</sup>
			At first, it was hard, especially because my dad is very <em>strict</em> when it comes to studying.<sup>(4)</sup>
			After that, during weekends, we always have to go and attend church. <sup>(5)</sup>
			In terms of studies, I started high school at <i>Niño Jesus House of Studies Inc</i>.<sup>(6)</sup>
			I have gained new set of friends although it was hard for me to adjust at first since I was a <i>transferee</i>. <sup>(7)</sup>
			Thankfully, I was able to overcome them, so every time we're having lunch, I am with my friends.<sup>(8)</sup>
			During teenage years, I have also discovered some of my <i>hobbies and interests</i> such as playing basketball, playing volleyball, drawing, dancing, and playing computer games.<sup>(9)</sup>
			I got <em>addicted</em> by some of these hobbies to the point that I almost failed one of my subjects.<sup>(10)</sup>
			But thankfully, I passed and survived them.<sup>(11)</sup>
			I was supposed to be a varsity in our school, however, we've decided once again that we'll live with our mom in Mandaluyong City, where we are residing right now.<sup>(12)</sup>
			So, I transferred to <i>Jose Rizal University</i> when I was in Grade 10, which is very close to our house.<sup>(13)</sup>
			At first, it was uncomfortable for me since it's a university, it's a big change comparing to my past schools.<sup>(14)</sup>
			Here, I've gained new set of friends that are for <em>keeps</em>.<sup>(15)</sup>
			After graduating high school, instead of going to college, I studied as a Senior High School because of the K-12 curriculum. <sup>(16)</sup>
			I stayed in <abbr title="Jose Rizal University">JRU</abbr> and took up <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics">STEM</abbr>.<sup>(17)</sup>
			I've gained new friends once again and this time, I've met a girl who I am seeing up until now.<sup>(18)</sup>
			During Senior High School, I have also learned to drink alcohol together with my friends.<sup>(19)</sup>
			It was really fun to be with them and I am glad we all survived <abbr title="Senior High School together">SHS</abbr>.<sup>(20)</sup>

		<H2>College Years</H2>
		<HR class="hr3" align="center"></HR>
			<P>
		
			&nbsp&nbsp College life is known as one of the most <em>memorable</em> years of one’s life.<sup>(1)</sup>
			They say that it is entirely different from high school life as it exposes us to new <em>experiences</em> and things that we were not familiar with earlier.<sup>(2)</sup>
			And I couldn't agree more to that, college life is indeed a <em>big transition</em> from school life. <sup>(3)</sup>
			When I started college, I had many struggles.<sup>(4)</sup>
			One of my struggles is picking the right school for me.<sup>(5)</sup>
			I've tried inquiring to several universities but I think <i>University of the East</i> have the best program for <i>Computer Science</i>.<sup>(6)</sup>
			And after contemplating, I enrolled in UE taking up <abbr title ="Bachelor of Science in Computer Science">BSCS</abbr> together with my girlfriend who is taking up <abbr title ="Bachelor of Science in Biology — Medical Biology Track">BS Bio</abbr>.<sup>(7)</sup>
			In <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr>, I have met new friends and I also saw some of my classmates from my former school. <sup>(8)</sup>
			It was fun studying in college since this time, I can already feel like I am preparing myself for my <em>future</em>, unlike in Senior High School where I feel like we were just having fun. <sup>(9)</sup>
			However, college life is not all about <em>happy days</em>.<sup>(10)</sup>
			During my first year as a college student, I struggled big time because of that one subject, <i>Calculus</i>.<sup>(11)</sup>
			Most of us found it hard since <i>Calculus</i> is a very difficult subject, especially with limited time given to us every time we're taking an exam.<sup>(12)</sup>
			I really do think that taking up this subject was one of my <em>greatest struggle</em> in college, not until <abbr title="2019 Corona Virus Disease">COVID-19</abbr> happened. <sup>(13)</sup>
			When the pandemic started, we had to cancel our <i>face-to-face</i> classes for 2 weeks.<sup>(14)</sup>
			And those 2 weeks was extended, up until now. <sup>(15)</sup>
			On my 2nd year as a college student, I was <em>hesitant</em> to enroll because I know it will be hard especially because we'll have the classes <i>virtually</i>, which was never done by most of us before.<sup>(16)</sup>
			However, I still enrolled because I don't want to feel like I'm behind everyone, I want to reach my <em>goals</em> sooner and become <em>successful</em> in the future.<sup>(17)</sup>
			Even though, I am still struggling with <i>online classes</i> and I don't think I will ever get used to this kind of set-up.<sup>(18)</sup>
			So, I am praying that all these will be over soon, so we could study more effectively <i>face-to-face</i>.<sup>(19)</sup>
			With that being said, I hope that I'll be able to conquer all my struggles during my college life and <q>become the successful man who I always wanted to be</q>.<sup>(20)</sup>
